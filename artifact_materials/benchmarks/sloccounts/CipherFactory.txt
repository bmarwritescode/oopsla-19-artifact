Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 1,556
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.32 (3.82)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.35 (4.16)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 0.92
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 42,979
