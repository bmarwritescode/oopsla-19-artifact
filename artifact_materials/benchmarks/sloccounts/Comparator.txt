Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
java:          1280 (100.00%)




Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 1,280
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.26 (3.11)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.32 (3.85)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 0.81
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 35,012
