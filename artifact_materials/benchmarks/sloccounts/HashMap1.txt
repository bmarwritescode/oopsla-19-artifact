Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
java:          1025 (100.00%)




Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 1,025
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.21 (2.46)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.29 (3.52)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 0.70
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 27,727
