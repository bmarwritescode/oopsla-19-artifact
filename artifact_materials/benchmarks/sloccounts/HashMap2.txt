Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
java:           936 (100.00%)




Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 936
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.19 (2.24)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.28 (3.40)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 0.66
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 25,205
 (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40).
